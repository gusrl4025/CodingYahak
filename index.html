    <h2>Game Engine</a></h2>
    <p>A game engine is a software-development environment designed for people to build video games. Developers use game engines to construct games for consoles, mobile devices, and personal computers.</p> <p>The core functionality typically provided by a game engine includes a rendering engine ("renderer") for 2D or 3D graphics, a physics engine or collision detection (and collision response), sound, scripting, animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, threading, localization support, scene graph, and may include video support for cinematics.</p> <p>Implementers often economize on the process of game development by reusing/adapting, in large part, the same game engine to produce different games[1] or to aid in porting games to multiple platforms.</p>
